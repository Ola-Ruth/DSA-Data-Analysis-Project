# DSA DATA ANALYSIS EXCEL PROJECT 
## Project Title: Amazon Product Review Analysis Report
### Project Overview
This project aimed to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Amazon product and customer review data.
The main objective was to generate actionable insights for Retail Tech Insights' e-commerce clients, to specifically enhance product improvement, provide a well refined marketing strategies, and optimize customer engagement.

### Data Source
The data was meticulously scraped from Amazon product pages. 
It comprises 1,465 product records, consisting of 16 columns of information related to product details (name, category, price, discount, ratings) and customer engagement metrics (user reviews, titles, and content).

### Tools Used
Pivot tables and Calculated columns were explicitly used to analyze the data to provide useful insight and draw inference.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the process of Data cleaning, I deleted duplicate Product ID, making the product ID distinct for each data record, then initial data processing was performed, resulting to 1,351 unique products. This involved handling missing values or inconsistencies to ensure data readiness for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involved addressing 14 specific business questions through data aggregation, filtering and calculation. This included examining discount distributions, product counts, review counts, rating patterns, price comparisons, and total potential revenue across various product categories. The analysis also explored the relationship between product ratings and discount levels.
